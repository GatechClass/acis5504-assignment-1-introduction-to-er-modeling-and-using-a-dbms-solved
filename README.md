Step 1: Create the following tables using MS Access or other DBMS.

This database will require the following entities (shown below). The primary key fields are denoted in

bold letters, and the foreign keys are denoted in italics and underlined.

Account(ANO, ANAME, STREET, CITY, STATE, ZIP)

Transactions(TID, TDATE, AMOUNT, STOREID, ANO)

Store(STOREID, SNAME, STREET, CITY, STATE, ZIP)

One account can have many transactions and one store can have many transactions.

When you take the quiz you will confirm that you created the tables.

Step 2: Create an ERD for this situation.

When you take the quiz you will be required to identify the correct ERD from multiple choices.

Step 3: Confirm the tables are presented in the assignment as a Relational Model.

When you take the quiz you will confirm that the tables are defined in a correct Relational Model format.

Step 4: Insert rows in the tables, at least 5 stores, 5 accounts, and 30 transactions.

When you take the quiz you will confirm that you populated the tables.

Step 5: Create a form that allows a user to insert and update data for a table.

When you take the quiz you will attest that you created the form.

Step 6: Create a report that lists all accounts.

When you take the quiz you will be required to identify the correct SQL for this report from multiple

choices.

Step 7: Create a report that lists all transactions for a given day.

When you take the quiz you will be required to identify the correct SQL for this report from multiple

choices.

Step 8: Create a report that is a monthly statement for a given individual account that lists the

date, Sname, and the amount of the transaction for that account. The user must specify the

month. At the end of the statement, the total amount should be summed.

When you take the quiz you will be required to identify the correct SQL for this report from multiple

choices.

Step 9: Create a report that lists all transactions for a given account number.

When you take the quiz you will be required to identify the correct SQL for this report from multiple

choices.

Step 10: Create a query that inserts a row into the Transaction table.

When you take the quiz you will be required to identify the correct SQL for this step from multiple

choices.

Step 11: Study Chapter 6: Normalization

When you take the quiz you will be required to identify remedies to normalization violations from multiple

choices.

Take the Quiz Again

Question 1

I confirm, consistent with VT Honor Code, that I completed all of the

following activities for this assignment: created a database including the

three tables indicated; inserted at least 5 stores, 5 accounts, and 30

transactions into the tables in my database; created a form that allows a

table rows to be inserted and updates; and created the SQL and

associated reports requested.

Yes, I completed all of the hands-on tasks

No, I was unable to complete all of the hands-on tasks

Ques 2 / 2 pts tion 2

Which one of the following UML models is correct for this situation:

a

b

c

d

Question 3

The entities and relationships for the situation are presented in the

assignment in the form of a relational model.

True

False Question 4

Which of the following SQL statements is correct for a report that list all

accounts?

SELECT * FROM transactions;

SELECT * FROM store;

SELECT ano, aname FROM account INNER JOIN transactions ON ano;

SELECT ano, aname FROM account ORDER BY ano;

Question 5

Which of the following SQL statements is correct for a monthly statement

for a given individual account that lists the date, Sname, and the amount

of the transactions for that account. The user must specify the account

number, month, and year.

SELECT tdate, sname, amount FROM transactions WHERE ano =

[ANO_REQUESTED] AND (MONTH(tdate ) = [MONTH_REQ] AND

YEAR(= [YEAR_REQ] );

SELECT tdate, sname, amount FROM transactions INNER JOIN store ON

transactions.storeid = store.storeid WHERE ano = [ANO_REQUESTED]

AND (MONTH(tdate ) = [MONTH_REQ] AND YEAR(tdate) = [YEAR_REQ]

) ORDER BY tdate, sname;

SELECT tdate, aname, amount FROM transactions WHERE ano =

[ANO_REQUESTED] AND (MONTH(tdate ) = [MONTH_REQ] AND

YEAR(tdate) = [YEAR_REQ] ) ORDER BY tdate, sname;

SELECT tdate, sname, amount FROM transactions WHERE ano =

[ANO_REQUESTED] AND (tdate = [MONTH_REQ] + [YEAR_REQ] )

ORDER BY sname;

Question 6

Which of the following SQL statements is correct for the total line of

monthly statement for a given individual account for a month and year.

The user must specify the account number, month, and year.

SELECT tdate, SUM(amount) FROM transactions WHERE ano =

[ANO_REQUESTED] AND (MONTH(tdate ) = [MONTH_REQUESTED]

AND YEAR(tdate) = [YEAR_REQUESTED] ) GROUP BY tdate;

SELECT MONTH(tdate), YEAR(tdate), amount FROM transactions

WHERE ano = [ANO_REQUESTED] AND (MONTH(tdate ) =

[MONTH_REQUESTED] AND YEAR(tdate) = [YEAR_REQUESTED] )

GROUP BY MONTH(tdate), YEAR(tdate);

SELECT MONTH(tdate), YEAR(tdate), SUM(amount) FROM transactions

WHERE ano = [ANO_REQUESTED] AND (MONTH(tdate ) =

[MONTH_REQUESTED] AND YEAR(tdate) = [YEAR_REQUESTED] )

GROUP BY MONTH(tdate), YEAR(tdate);

SELECT MONTH(tdate), YEAR(tdate), SUM(amount) FROM transactions,

account WHERE ano = [ANO_REQUESTED] AND (MONTH(tdate ) =

[MONTH_REQUESTED] AND YEAR(tdate) = [YEAR_REQUESTED] )

GROUP BY MONTH(tdate), YEAR(tdate);

Question 7

Which of the following SQL statements is correct for a list of all the

transactions for a requested account number.

ELECT tdate, sname, amount FROM account WHERE ano =

[ANO_REQUESTED];

SELECT tdate, sname, amount FROM transactions, store WHERE

transactions.storeid = store.storeid AND ano = [ANO_REQUESTED];

SELECT tdate, sname, amount FROM account, transactions WHERE

account.ano = [ANO_REQUESTED];

SELECT tdate, sname, amount FROM transactions, account WHERE

transaction.ano = [ANO_REQUESTED];

Question 8

Denormalization produces a lower normal form.

True

False

Question 9

Dependencies that are based on only a part of a composite primary key

are called transitive dependencies.

True

False

Question 10

Since a partial dependency can exist only if a tableâ€™s primary key is

composed of several attributes, if a table in 1NF has a single-attribute

primary key, then the table is automatically in 2NF.

True

False

Question 11

Attribute A _____ attribute B if all of the rows in the table that agree in

value for attribute A also agree in value for attribute B.

determines

derives from

controls

owns

none of the above
